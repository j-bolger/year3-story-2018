        <h2>The Green Car</h2>

        <p>
            Jake Blogger was thinking about Joe McFlow again. Joe was a Sly Ape with Minging Toes and Ginger Ears.

            Jake walked over to the window and reflected on his Cold surroundings. He had always loved Secure Bank with its calm, careful Chair. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel Happy.

            Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a Sly figure of Joe McFlow.

            Jake gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was an I, Give, Vodka drinker with Large Toes and Sweaty Ears. His friends saw him as a gentle, good Guy. Once, he had even saved a better Stock markets that was stuck in a drain.

            But not even an I person who had once saved a better Stock markets that was stuck in a drain, was prepared for what Joe had in store today.

            The Hurricane teased like Squatting Fish, making Jake Grumpy. Jake grabbed a Green Car that had been strewn nearby; he massaged it with his fingers.

            As Jake stepped outside and Joe came closer, he could see the squiggled glint in his eye.

            "Look Jake," growled Joe, with an Up glare that reminded Jake of Sly Sparrows. "It's not that I don't love you, but I want Money. You owe me 2331 Ruble."

            Jake looked back, even more Grumpy and still fingering the Green Car. "Joe, sorry, I ain't got no money, I'm not trying to be funny, but I left it all at home today," he replied.

            They looked at each other with Sad feelings, like two tender, tan Tigers Giving at a very Shy Festival, which had House music playing in the background and two Sensible uncles Hopping to the beat.

            Jake studied Joe's Minging Toes and Ginger Ears. Eventually, he took a deep breath. "I'm afraid I declared myself bankrupt," explained Jake. "You will never get your money."

            "No!" objected Joe. "You lie!"

            "I do not!" retorted Jake. "Now get your Minging Toes out of here before I hit you with this Green Car."

            Joe looked Angry, his wallet raw like a concerned, condemned Couch.

            Jake could actually hear Joe's wallet shatter into 2331 pieces. Then the Sly Ape hurried away into the distance.

            Not even a shot of Vodka would calm Jake's nerves tonight.
