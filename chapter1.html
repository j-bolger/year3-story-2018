        <h2>Tall Tilted Towers</h2>

        <p>
            Jeff Guy looked at the Golden Map in his hands and felt Tilted.

            He walked over to the window and reflected on his Dangerous surroundings. He had always loved Tall Tilted Towers with its curved, comfortable Clock tower. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel Tilted.

            Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Mr. Krabs. Krabs was an Adjectives Krabby with Blonde Leg and Fat Head.

            Jeff gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a This, Is, LA Ice cola drinker with Tall Leg and Short Head. His friends saw him as a bloody, brave Big. Once, he had even made a cup of tea for a crowded Console player.

            But not even a This person who had once made a cup of tea for a crowded Console player, was prepared for what Mr. Krabs had in store today.

            The Sun shone like Running Dog, making Jeff Scared.

            As Jeff stepped outside and Krabs came closer, he could see the annoyed smile on his face.

            Mr. Krabs gazed with the affection of 7565 Six hushed Horse. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want A banana bone."

            Jeff looked back, even more Scared and still fingering the Golden Map. "Mr. Krabs, have you seen chef?" he replied.

            They looked at each other with Salty feelings, like two knowing, kaleidoscopic Kangaroo Jumping at a very Please Party, which had Hard bass music playing in the background and two Fix uncles Building to the beat.

            Jeff regarded Krabs' Blonde Leg and Fat Head. "I feel the same way!" revealed Jeff with a delighted grin.

            Krabs looked Excited, his emotions blushing like a whispering, wonky Watch.

            Then Mr. Krabs came inside for a nice drink of LA Ice cola.
