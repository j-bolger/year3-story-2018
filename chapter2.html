        <h2>Two WTF Uncles Laughing to the Beat</h2>

        <p>
            Killer Keemstar had always hated Vile Vidcon with its vacant, vigorous Vloggers. It was a place where he felt Angery.

            He was a This, Is, Pepsi drinker with Gnomish Hair and Small Fingers. His friends saw him as a gigantic, great Gnome. Once, he had even revived a dying, Youtube ad revenue. That's the sort of man he was.

            Killer walked over to the window and reflected on his Cringey surroundings. The Snow flurried like Punching Dogs.

            Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Jake Paul. Jake was a Six Penis with Blonde Hair and Tall Fingers.

            Killer gulped. He was not prepared for Jake.

            As Killer stepped outside and Jake came closer, he could see the square glint in his eye.

            "I am here because I want Drama," Jake bellowed, in a Still tone. He slammed his fist against Killer's chest, with the force of 7280 Mice. "I frigging hate you, Killer Keemstar."

            Killer looked back, even more Ecstatic and still fingering the Round Fans. "Jake, let's get riiight, into the news," he replied.

            They looked at each other with Disgusted feelings, like two cautious, cuddly Cats Dying at a very Adjectives Boxing match, which had Progressive Glitch Wave music playing in the background and two Wtf uncles Laughing to the beat.

            Killer studied Jake's Blonde Hair and Tall Fingers. Eventually, he took a deep breath. "I'm sorry, but I can't give you Drama," he explained, in pitying tones.

            Jake looked Happy, his body raw like a vast, villainous Views.

            Killer could actually hear Jake's body shatter into 3805 pieces. Then the Six Penis hurried away into the distance.

            Not even a drink of Pepsi would calm Killer's nerves tonight.
